# pomodoro 

**pomodoro**

*Noun:*  
A time management method
    
## Description

A simple python app that I wrote to emulate the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
I tried a few apps on my own but none really fell into my workflow, so I wrote this quick python app. 

I will add to it if I find it useful and if not then no worries, no harm no foul.

It currently only cares about working on a Mac, deal with it :)
